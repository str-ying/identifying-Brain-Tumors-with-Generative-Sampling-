This project will analyze brain tumor based on x-ray images of brains. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle, created by Navoneel Chakrabarty. The most unique values in the dataset will be the image attribute, while having different pictures and separated into tumor and normal classes. This dataset will be used as the sample set which will be mixed with the generative model from a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).â€¯This project will then use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to the original dataset and the sample set mixed with samples generated from the VAE. The performance of the accuracy of the model created from these sample sets will be analyzed.
